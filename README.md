# From_Sequence_to_Structure

[From sequence to structure: Uncovering substructure reasoning in transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10435) (Neurips2025)

The code is modified from https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT, please refer their evnviroment setting.

run code:

Note you need to fix the paths in my_prepare.py, my_train.py, config.py

1. generate graphs: python generation.py

The following are modified from nanoGPT

2. initialize the tokenizer for the model: my_prepare.py

3. train the model: python my_train.py or python my_train.py config.py

4. eval.py for the numerical results and vis.ipynb for the visualization results (diamond example)

(I’ll do my best to address any issues, though I may be busy at times. Please note that I won’t respond to questions related to paths or environment setups.)
